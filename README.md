# age-comparison

Collaborated with three colleagues at the University. The aim was to determine the age relationship between individuals A and B using their facial images.
It's a three-class problem: older, same age, and younger. Challenges include variations in ageing signs and lighting conditions.
The dataset contains 45,000 labelled pairs of 192x192 colour images, evenly distributed among the classes.
Google Colab was utilized for efficient model training with GPU support. Our goal is to build a robust age classification model considering these challenges.
